üó£Ô∏è Customer Sentiment Analysis
# Project Overview
Customer Sentiment Analysis leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate customer feedback and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.
By analyzing transcripts from voice calls, chats, and emails, this project uncovers insights that help businesses monitor brand perception, detect pain points, and improve customer experience.

This solution integrates text preprocessing, sentiment classification models, and interactive visualizations to deliver actionable business intelligence.

# Problem Statement
Businesses receive vast amounts of customer feedback through multiple channels, but manually assessing sentiment is time-consuming and prone to bias.
This project automates the process by:

Analyzing voice, chat, and email transcripts.

Classifying sentiment across different companies.

Generating insights to improve decision-making and customer satisfaction.

# üõ†Ô∏è Project Objectives
Analyze customer transcripts using NLP techniques.

Classify sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

Build machine learning models for automated sentiment classification.

Visualize results in Tableau for clear, actionable reporting.

Identify sentiment patterns and trends across companies.

Recommend strategies for enhancing customer experience.

Methodology
Data Collection

Gather customer feedback from multiple channels and companies.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Remove noise (punctuation, special characters, stopwords).

Tokenize and lemmatize text.

Transform into numerical form using TF-IDF.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify most frequent words, topics, and sentiment distribution.

Detect trends over time and across companies.

Model Development

Implement and compare Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and KNN classifiers.

Achieved 79% accuracy on classification.

Visualization

Created interactive Tableau dashboards showing sentiment breakdown, keyword frequency, and company comparisons.

Insights & Recommendations

Highlighted sentiment variations by company.

Identified recurring customer concerns and satisfaction drivers.

üìä Key Insights
Majority of negative feedback was linked to delivery delays and product defects.

Positive sentiment peaked during seasonal promotions.

Company A had consistently higher satisfaction scores compared to peers.

üöÄ Results
Accuracy Achieved: 79% (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN).

Deliverables: Preprocessed dataset, trained models, Tableau dashboards.

Impact: Provided a scalable way to monitor and improve customer sentiment tracking.

üí° Future Enhancements
Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for improved accuracy.

Incorporate real-time sentiment tracking from live chats or social media.

Perform aspect-based sentiment analysis for granular topic insights.
